* emacs-mac-follow-appearance
A plugin that lets you pick themes for macOS Dark and Light modes. Theme changing happens automatically and follows your system's appearance. Works only with Yamamoto Mitsuharu's emacs-mac-port.

No polling, no background checks, no AppleScript. Uses built-in event handlers and somehow even manages to change themes with a nice animation.
